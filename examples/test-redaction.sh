# Test redaction by sending a request with sensitive data through the proxy.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Start the proxy: ctxio proxy --redact --port 4040
#   2. Run this script:  ./examples/test-redaction.sh
#
# The script sends a fake Anthropic API request containing PII and secrets,
# then shows what the proxy forwarded. Since there's no real upstream, the
# proxy will return a 502, but the capture file shows the redacted request.
